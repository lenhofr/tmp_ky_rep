Primary Goal: Learn about your platform
Design Style: Modern & energetic
Donations: No donations needed
Features: Endorsements section, Newsletter/email signup

This is really helpful! So your main focus is on educating voters about your platform with a modern, energetic feel. You want endorsements and newsletter signup, but no donation processing. That simplifies things nicely.

Questions
What are 2-3 key issues central to your campaign? (This helps me plan the platform/issues section)

Jobs, wages, cost of living, local business support

Key Issues: Economy & Jobs, Education, Healthcare

Excellent! Economy & Jobs, Education, and Healthcare are strong, relatable issues. Now I have a clear picture of what you need.
